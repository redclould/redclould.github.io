Introduction    The 6th World Students Pair Go Championship were hold in Tokyo, from 8 to 9 December 2019. We believe that within international society, the game of go uses black and white stones as an international language and that it is an ideal intellectual sport in which differences of nationality, sex, and age irrelevant. Based on this standpoint, the goal of the Pair Go tournament is not only to demonstrate the fascination of go as widely as possible by adopting the male-female pair system but also to develop this pair system as a new way of enjoying the game and to provide opportunities for international exchange on a regular, permanent and ever-increasing basis.</description>
