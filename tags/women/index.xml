Introduction    The 21th Women&amp;rsquo;s Go National Championship was held for over 20 years. It encouraged women to play Go and enjoy it. We believed that several players have been so much love in playing Go and attracting more people to join in this interesting field. Therefore, we hold this tournament just for female players to give them a showcase to show their abilities.</description>
