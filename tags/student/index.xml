Based on this standpoint, the goal of the Pair Go tournament is not only to demonstrate the fascination of go as widely as possible by adopting the male-female pair system but also to develop this pair system as a new way of enjoying the game and to provide opportunities for international exchange on a regular, permanent and ever-increasing basis.</description>
